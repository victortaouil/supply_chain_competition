# supply_chain_competition

This study was a DataCamp Python competition based on a given database about a shipment company. Their deliveries, delays, fulfillment storage and so on. 
We should get insightful information that could benefits the company. Below I show some os mine discoveries, and all of them can be seen at the branch main. 


ðŸ’ª Challenge
Using either Tableau or Power BI, create an interactive dashboard to summarize your research. Things to consider:

ðŸ›‘ There is great inefficiency on the order delivering, on average, 52.22% of the orders are not delivered on time. Therefore, using the report dynamically, it is possible to understand that there are forms of delivery with 80% performance (Same Day), while others (First Class) with 3% delivery on time.

ðŸ›‘ An important indicator in this case is the index that measures how much we are in excess or shortage of stock at the time there is an order confirmation.Not having the product in stock would possibly cause delay in delivery, on the other hand, having too much would cause unnecessary costs. This metric was analyzed monthly and showed a relatively satisfactory performance, with its average at 0.99 and most products circulating around the average. The closer this indicator is to zero, the smaller our inventory in relation to demand, if it is greater than 1 it is a sign that we have more inventory than we need. However the indicator seems to be fine by now, we should monitorate this very carefully.

And so much more discoveries we could get in this DataCamp competition
